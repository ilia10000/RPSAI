Additional features to track:
- Play speed (overall and between each move)
- Every play by both AI and Player
- Number of plays, wins, losses, ties
- Weighting algorithm used
- Weight attributed to each potential length
- Initial conditions (trained vs untrained)

Additional in-game functionality:
- Force player to play fast (counter or depleting bar?)
- Remove need to press "Enter" key

Additional meta-functionality:
- Create nice CSVs/datastores
- Amalgamate data by name
- Interactive GUI
- Wrapper script for launch

Research:
- Identify optimal tracking-window length algorithm
- Create more test data
- Do formal null hypothesis for Problem 1: Do there exist predictable (non-random) chains in human impulsive behavior?
- Formalize Problem 2: What are the lengths of these chains?
