Additional features to track:
- Play speed (overall and between each move) #DONE
- Every play by both AI and Player
- Number of plays, wins, losses, ties #DONE
- Weighting algorithm used #DONE
- Weight attributed to each potential length
- Initial conditions (trained vs untrained)

Additional in-game functionality:
- Force player to play fast (counter or depleting bar?) #DONE
- Remove need to press "Enter" key #Added ability to type many moves
- Change key mapping to adjacent keys

Additional meta-functionality:
- Create nice CSVs/datastores
- Amalgamate data by name #Added nice folder structure
- Interactive GUI
- Wrapper script for launch
- Fix parameter display upon quitting game. 
- Need much larger dataset to properly test larger windows
- Save log file and separate analysis result file

Research:
- Identify optimal tracking-window length algorithm
- Create more test data
- Do formal null hypothesis for Problem 1: Do there exist predictable (non-random) chains in human impulsive behavior?
- Formalize Problem 2: What are the lengths of these chains?
- Continue reading papers
- Limit history to preloaded file, don't add in current moves, this will allow us to study performance against past data.
